\section*{Problem 1} % Done
Given a frequency of 450 KHz, calculate the corresponding time period.\\\\

To determine the period we will use the following formula:\\
$T = \frac{1}{f}$.\\
Plugging in $T = \frac{1}{450 * 10^{3}}$.\\
Giving us the result of $2.22 *10^{-6}$s or a final result of\\
$2.22\mu$s

\section*{Problem 2} % Done
Given a time period of 420 ns, calculate the corresponding frequency.\\\\
To determine the period we will use the following formula:\\
$f = \frac{1}{T}$.\\
$f = \frac{1}{420 * 10^{-9}}$
$f = 2.4 * 10^{6}$.\\
Giving us a final result of $2.4$MHz.\\

\section*{Problem 3} % NEED TO DO STILL

\hspace{20mm}a. A signal in which 1 bit lasts 0.00003s.\\

\hspace{20mm}b. A signal in which 25 bits last 350 μs.\\

\section*{Problem 4} % Done
A device is transmitting data at a rate of 2500 bps.\\\\
\subP How long does it take to send out a single character (8 bits).\\
To determine this we will use the following formula.\\
$t = \frac{s*c}{r}$.\\
Where t is the time, s is the total amount of characters, c is the size of a character,
and r is the rate of data transmission.\\
Plugging in we get\\
$t = \frac{8}{2500}$\\
$t = 0.0032$s
or a final result of $3.2$ms.\\\\


\subP How long does it take to send a file of 250,000 characters (each
character is 8 bits)?\\
To determine this we will use the following formula.\\
$t = \frac{s*c}{r}$.\\
Where t is the time, s is the total amount of characters, c is the size of a character,
and r is the rate of data transmission.\\
Plugging in we get\\
$t = \frac{250,000 * 8}{2500}$.\\
$t = 800$s.\\

\section*{Problem 5} % Done
What is the theoretical capacity of a channel in each of the following cases:\\\\
\subP a. Bandwidth: 350 KHz, SNRdB = 50.\\
To determine this we will use the following equation:\\
$c = BW * log_{2}(1 + 10^{(SNRdb)/10})$.\\
$c = 350 * 10^{3} * log_{2}(1 + 10^{50/10})$.\\
$c = 350 * 10^{3} * log_{2}(1 + 10^{5})$.\\
$c = 350 * 10^{3} * 13.288$.\\
$c = 4650 * 10^{3}$.\\
Giving us a final capacity of 4.65 Mb/s

\subP b. Bandwidth: 17 MHz, SNRdB = 25.\\
$c = BW * log_{2}(1 + 10^{(SNRdb)/10})$.\\
$c = 17 * 10^{6} * log_{2}(1 + 10^{25/10})$.\\
$c = 17 * 10^{6} * log_{2}(1 + 10^{2.5})$.\\
$c = 17 * 10^{6} * 8.308$.\\
$c = 141.2 * 10^{6}$.\\
Giving us a final capacity of 141.2 Mb/s

$N = 70,000$ sample/s\\

\subP b. A band-pass signal with bandwidth of 350 KHz if the lowest
frequency is 250 KHz.\\
For a band pass filter we can use the following equation:\\
$N = 2*f_{m}$.\\
Where $f_{m}$ is the highest frequency of the signal.\\
Plugging in we get $N = 2*(250 + 350) * 10^{3}$.\\
$N = 1,200,000$ sample/s\\

Assume that a voice channel occupies a bandwidth of 4 kHz. We need to multiplex 30 voice
channels with guard bands of 500 Hz separating the channels using FDM. Calculate the total

To determine the required bandwidth we will use the following equation:\\
$BW = 30(BW_{c} BW_{g})$.\\
$BW = 30(4000 + 500)$.\\
